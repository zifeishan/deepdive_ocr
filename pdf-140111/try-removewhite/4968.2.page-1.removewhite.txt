paper
is
based
upon
studies
on
the
parasitic

contained
in
the
very
extensive
collection
of
many
years
ago
by
Dr.
Samuel
H.
Scudder
at

nnd
now
oontained

has
sent
me
much
material

some
locality
obtained
by
expeditions
under
his
charge
during
_the=sun1n1fers
of
190?
and
1908,

In
all
I
"have
had
the
opportunity
to
examine
over
700
well-preserved
speoiimens
of
insects
belonging
to
this
group,
among
which
there
are
312
clearly
species
which
are
described
on.th.e,following

Aczlding
